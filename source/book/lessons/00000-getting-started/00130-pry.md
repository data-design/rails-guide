Using the interactive Ruby shell is both a great way to explore the language and to debug complex applications. `irb` is installed in Ruby by default and works well, but the `pry` gem offers enough niceties and features to make `pry` a necessity for the Ruby power user.

## Installing `pry`

You can install `pry` like any other gem:

    gem install pry

To use it with a Rails application, it's as easy as bundling the `pry-rails` gem in your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'pry-rails'

And then running `bundle install`

Now when you run `rails c` from the command line, the console will automatically use `pry`.


## Introduction to `pry`

Run it as if it were __irb__: 

~~~shell
bash:path user$ pry
## Now we're in pry
[1] pry(main)> puts "hello pry"
hello pry
=> nil
[2] pry(main)> 
~~~


### Getting help

Running `help` at the `pry` prompt will show you the `pry`-specific functionality.

~~~
pry(main)> help
Help
  help               Show a list of commands or information about a specific com

Context
  cd                 Move into a new context (object or scope).
  find-method        Recursively search for a method within a Class/Module or th
  ls                 Show the list of vars and methods in the current scope.
  pry-backtrace      Show the backtrace for the Pry session.
  # etc etc etc
~~~


To find `help` on a specific command:

~~~
pry(main)> help hist
Usage:   hist [--head|--tail]
         hist --head N
         hist --tail N
         hist --show START..END
         hist --grep PATTERN
         hist --clear
         hist --replay START..END
         hist --save [START..END] FILE
Aliases: history

Show and replay Readline history.

    -H, --head             Display the first N items
    -T, --tail             Display the last N items
    -s, --show             Show the given range of lines

# and more...
~~~

(We'll cover the eminently useful `hist` command later in this chapter.)


### Visually convenient output

Using __pry__ is pretty much the same as using __irb__. But even without doing anything __pry__-specific, you'll see that __pry__ makes some useful assumptions about what you'd like to see.

For example, what I constantly do is forget what methods belong to a particular object. You can bring up that list with an object's `methods` method. To see the methods you can invoke on a `Fixnum`:

~~~ruby
42.methods
~~~

Note: The follow examples uses __screenshots__ of the console, which reflect how __irb__ and __pry__ use color. The rest of this article will be showing Ruby syntax via the standard HTML code highlighter.

This is __irb__'s default output:

~~~ruby
irb(main):002:0> 42.methods
=> [:to_s, :inspect, :-@, :+, :-, :*, :/, :div, :%, :modulo, :divmod, :fdiv, :**, :abs, :magnitude, :==, :===, :<=>, :>, :>=, :<, :<=, :~, :&, :|, :^, :[], :<<, :>>, :to_f, :size, :zero?, :odd?, :even?, :succ, :integer?, :upto, :downto, :times, :next, :pred, :chr, :ord, :to_i, :to_int, :floor, :ceil, :truncate, :round, :gcd, :lcm, :gcdlcm, :numerator, :denominator, :to_r, :rationalize, :singleton_method_added, :coerce, :i, :+@, :eql?, :quo, :remainder, :real?, :nonzero?, :step, :to_c, :real, :imaginary, :imag, :abs2, :arg, :angle, :phase, :rectangular, :rect, :polar, :conjugate, :conj, :between?, :nil?, :=~, :!~, :hash, :class, :singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :taint, :tainted?, :untaint, :untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :freeze, :frozen?, :methods, :singleton_methods, :protected_methods, :private_methods, :public_methods, :instance_variables, :instance_variable_get, :instance_variable_set, :instance_variable_defined?, :remove_instance_variable, :instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :send, :public_send, :respond_to?, :extend, :display, :method, :public_method, :define_singleton_method, :object_id, :to_enum, :enum_for, :equal?, :!, :!=, :instance_eval, :instance_exec, :__send__, :__id__]
~~~

This is __pry__'s:

~~~ruby
[2] pry(main)> 42.methods
=> [:to_s,
 :inspect,
 :-@,
 :+,
 :-,
 :*,
 :/,
 :div,
 :%,
 :modulo,
 :divmod,
 :fdiv,
 :**,
 :abs,
 :magnitude,
 # and so forth
~~~


By default, __pry__ has highlighted-syntax and assumes the long list of method names is easier to see as a line-by-line, rather than as a clump of data. If an object contains lengthy values, __pry__ will by default show them line-by-line, whether it's a Hash or an Array:

~~~ruby
# Output of Hash containing long values:
pry(main)> person.attributes
=> {"id"=>2,
 "full_name"=>"John Doe",
 "created_at"=>Sun, 02 Mar 2014 17:13:36 UTC +00:00,
 "updated_at"=>Sun, 02 Mar 2014 17:13:36 UTC +00:00}

# Output of Array containing long values:
pry(main)> Array(person.attributes)
=> [["id", 2],
 ["full_name", "John Doe"],
 ["created_at", Sun, 02 Mar 2014 17:13:36 UTC +00:00],
 ["updated_at", Sun, 02 Mar 2014 17:13:36 UTC +00:00]]
~~~

However, it is smart enough to know that shorter values can be seen easier as a single clump:

~~~ruby
# Output of Array containing short values:
pry(main)> Array(person.attributes)[0..1]
=> [["id", 2], ["full_name", "John Doe"]]

# Output of Hash containing short values:
pry(main)> Hash[Array(person.attributes)[0..1]]
=> {"id"=>2, "full_name"=>"John Doe"}
~~~



## Navigating with `pry`

(Warning: hopefully you're cognizant of the difference between your operating system's shell and the interactive Ruby shell, or you're going to be _very_ confused by `ls` and `cd`)

Like __bash__, __pry__ offers the `ls` and `cd` shell commands, except in __pry__-world, you use these to navigate within the current Ruby environment.


Let's create some new variables:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> my_string = 'Hello world'
pry(main)> my_number = 42.42
~~~

If you operate in the Ruby shell long enough, you'll sometimes lose track of what variables are floating around. Using `ls` will list these:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> ls
self.methods: inspect  to_s
locals: _  __  _dir_  _ex_  _file_  _in_  _out_  _pry_  my_number  my_string
~~~

Along with the standard functions available when you start in a new shell, you can see that pry helpfully lists the two local variables we've just created, `my_number` and `my_string`.


And if you are really getting in deep (which you _will_ when you use the shell to debug a Rails app), sometimes you'll forget where you are. But there's a pry command for that:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> whereami
At the top level.
~~~

Thanks pry!

### Entering new scopes

With pry's `cd`, we can jump _inside_ an object:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> cd my_string
pry("Hello world"):1> whereami
Inside "Hello world".
~~~

What does it mean to be inside `my_string` (i.e. the `String` that contains the value of `"Hello world"`)? For starters, `ls` now lists the methods available to `my_string` (i.e. _any_ `String` instance):

~~~
Comparable#methods: <  <=  >  >=  between?
String#methods: 
  %            chop!           getbyte    reverse      succ           
  *            chr             gsub       reverse!     succ!          
  +            clear           gsub!      rindex       sum            
  <<           codepoints      hash       rjust        swapcase       
  <=>          concat          hex        rpartition   swapcase!      
  ==           count           include?   rstrip       to_c           
  ===          crypt           index      rstrip!      to_f           
  =~           delete          insert     scan         to_i           
  []           delete!         inspect    setbyte      to_r           
  []=          downcase        intern     shell_split  to_s

# and more...
~~~

This is pretty sweet, because if you were to use the standard `methods` call for `my_string`, you'd see __all__ of its methods, including methods available to every Ruby object. So pry's `ls` shows you the most relevant methods and conveniently organizes them by modules: note that the `<=` operator, for instance, is available to strings because the `String` class includes the `Comparable` module, not because `<=` is explicitly part of the `String` class.

Now that we're _inside_ `my_string`, `self` behaves as you'd expect:

~~~ruby
pry("Hello world"):1> self.class
=> String
pry("Hello world"):1> self.upcase
=> "HELLO WORLD"
~~~

And of course, we no longer have access to variables that were _local_ to the top Ruby environment:

~~~
pry("Hello world"):1> puts my_number
NameError: undefined local variable or method `my_number' for "Hello world":String
~~~

So use `cd` as you would in your __bash__ prompt:

~~~
pry("Hello world"):1> cd ..
pry(main)> whereami
At the top level.
pry(main)> my_number
=> 42.42
~~~



## History

Now, interactive shells are great, because you get to see things happen as you type them. The problem with interactive shells, of course, is that you're __typing__ things, i.e. with your clumsy human fingers. After prolonged coding, you'll frequently be screwing up a long sequence of commands at the last possible moment:

~~~ruby
[9] pry(main)> string_1 = 'hello'
=> "hello"
[10] pry(main)> string_2 = 'world'
=> "world"
[11] pry(main)> string_1.upcase!
=> "HELLO"
[12] pry(main)> string_2.upcase!
=> "WORLD"
[13] pry(main)> string_3 = string_1 + ' ' + string2
# NameError: undefined local variable or method `string2' for main:Object
# from (pry):7:in `__pry__'
~~~

Since I entered this line-by-line, I can't simply copy-and-paste from the console without getting rid of the meta-junk. 

Enter pry's `hist` (short for `history`) command:

~~~ruby
[14] pry(main)> hist
1: hist -c
2: string_1 = 'hello'
3: string_2 = 'world'
4: string_1.upcase!
5: string_2.upcase!
6: string_3 = string_1 + ' ' + string2
~~~

Much cleaner. Now if I wanted to directly copy and paste everything (except for the damned `line 6`), I could the `--no-numbers` flag:

~~~ruby
[15] pry(main)> hist -n
hist -c
string_1 = 'hello'
string_2 = 'world'
string_1.upcase!
string_2.upcase!
string_3 = string_1 + ' ' + string2
hist
~~~

This works for immediate and minor mistakes. But the history will get cluttered in time, especially if you keep calling `hist` and `help hist`, because those calls will show up in the history too.

And frankly, copy-and-paste by manually highlighting code is for amateurs, because you'll often highlight the _erroneous line_ and re-execute it (those who use their mouse for input are doomed to repeat history, and so forth). Let's assume I make this _new_ error:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> string_3 = string_1 + ' ' + String_2
# NameError: uninitialized constant String_2
~~~


So let's view the history _with_ line numbers again:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> hist
1: hist -c
 2: string_1 = 'hello'
 3: string_2 = 'world'
 4: string_1.upcase!
 5: string_2.upcase!
 6: string_3 = string_1 + ' ' + string2
 7: hist
 8: hist -n
 9: string_1 = 'hello'
10: string_2 = 'world'
11: string_1.upcase!
12: string_2.upcase!
13: string_3 = string_1 + ' ' + String_2
~~~

If lines __2 through 5__ are good, but we keep screwing up at line 6, then let's just `show` those lines:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> hist -s 2..5
2: string_1 = 'hello'
3: string_2 = 'world'
4: string_1.upcase!
5: string_2.upcase!
~~~

And rather than manually copying-and-pasting, let's just `replay` them:

~~~ruby
pry(main)> hist -r 2..5
=> "hello"
=> "world"
=> "HELLO"
=> "WORLD"
~~~

And _then_ take a deep breath and execute a properly typed command.

There are a few more useful `hist` related flags, including `--tail` which shows the most _recent_ commands, `--grep` to show just lines with a pattern, and `--save`, which saves your work into a file.


## Debugging

To figure out errors deep in a large Ruby script, we can manually insert a call to pause the current program's execution just to figure out what the hell is going on.

Pretend you have a Ruby script,  `embiggen.rb`:

~~~ruby
# This function takes in a String and returns a copy of it that is:
# 1. in uppercase
# 2. with 0 to 9 exclamation points after it
def embiggen(str)
  # capitalize str
  str.upcase
  # add some exclamation points
  r = rand(10)
  str += Array.new(r, '!').join()
  
  return str
end

str = Array(ARGV).join(' ')
puts embiggen(str)
~~~

Running the following:

    ruby embiggen.rb hello world

We expect something like this:

    $ ruby embiggen.rb hello world
    HELLO WORLD!!!!!!!!

But instead, we get something like this:

    $ ruby embiggen.rb hello world
    hello world!!!!!!!!

Why is the output not capitalized? Do we enter a `pry` session and manually tinker and paste in the `embiggen.rb` script until it works? You _could_ do this, but it'd be kind of a hassle because this particular script depends on command-line arguments (that `str = Array(ARGV).join(' ')`) and so you'd have to comment that line out and put something in its place and then remember to uncomment it after you fixed the problem...

What a pain. But with `pry`, we can leave the script as is, _and_ choose exactly where we want to manually futz around. We just have to _include_ the `pry` gem and then _insert_ the `binding.pry` command, which will pause the script and yield control over to us.

The `str` variable is not being upper-cased so it's logical to `pry` in there:

~~~ruby
require 'pry'
# This function takes in a String and returns a copy of it that is:
# 1. in uppercase
# 2. with 0 to 9 exclamation points after it
def embiggen(str)
  # capitalize str
  str.upcase
  binding.pry
  # add some exclamation points
  r = rand(10)
  str += Array.new(r, '!').join()
  
  return str
end

str = Array(ARGV).join(' ')
puts embiggen(str)
~~~


Now re-run the script from the command line:


 ruby embiggen.rb hello world

From: /Users/dairy/testruns/testrails/embiggen.rb @ line 8 Object#embiggen:

~~~ruby
     5: def embiggen(str)
     6:   # capitalize str
     7:   str.upcase
 =>  8:   binding.pry
     9:   # add some exclamation points
    10:   r = rand(10)
    11:   str += Array.new(r, '!').join()
    12: 
    13:   return str
    14: end

pry(main)> 
~~~

Look at that; we have access to the __pry__ prompt, but __pry__ has helpfully pointed out _where_ the interpreter is. Even more convenient, we have access to the `str` variable. And we can play around with it like so:

~~~
pry(main)> str
=> "hello world"
~~~

Note: You can't see what's in the random `r` variable because you _aren't there_ yet:

~~~
pry(main)> r
=> nil
~~~

No matter, we just need to deal with `str`. The issue here is that `str` needs to either be _re-assigned_ to a capitalized version of itself:

    str = str.upcase

Or, use the _bang!_ version of `upcase`:

    str.upcase!


Type either of those in, and then type `exit`: this will yield control back to the interpreter:

~~~
[4] pry(main)> str = str.upcase
=> "HELLO WORLD"
[5] pry(main)> exit
HELLO WORLD!!!!!!!!
$
~~~

Nice! Now you can just re-edit `embiggen.rb` (and take out the `pry` stuff) and you're good to go.

__Pro-tip:__ Hell, why not just edit `embiggen.rb` while we're in there? At the prompt, you can type in `edit embiggen` which will send you off to your preferred text-editor, where you can edit and save the file. I'm not cool enough to do this, but the option is there.

## Wrap-up

This is just a quick introduction to __pry__ and its many nifty features. For the rest of this guide, we'll continue to use it for debugging purposes.
